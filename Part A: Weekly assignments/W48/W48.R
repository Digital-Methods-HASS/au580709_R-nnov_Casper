# Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with esri layers, 
# but call it DANmap



########## ADD DATA TO LEAFLET

# In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial
# data from GoogleMaps: 

### First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1  
### Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark 
# extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
# Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 

# Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

### Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
# watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number 
# that corresponds to the account you wish to use.

# Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet? Google "clustering options in Leaflet"

# Task 4: Look at the map and consider what it is good for and what not.
## In this case, the cluster function is good for creating an overview, instead of having all the markings on one map. For example, in the area around Silkeborg there are 3 markings, but the cluster function gathers it into a cluster so that they are assembled.


# Task 5: Find out how to display notes and classifications in the map.
